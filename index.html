                        <h4>About the Visualization</h4>

                        <p>Kickstarter is a crowd-funding platform for entrepreneurs, early stage start-ups and really anyone
                            with a great idea to raise funds for their idea and starting businesses. The idea is simple,
                            mass audience will fund your idea if they think it is worthy. In exchange the seller promises
                            some sort of product or service rendered in the future. It is a great place to to start testing
                            the adoption of your idea or product before putting forward the work to even create it. A lot
                            of entrepreneurs use the platform as a tool to test the demand for a given service or product,
                            making the platform a first go-to resources for many.
                            <p>
                                Not all projects on Kickstarter are equal though. This kind of comparison can be made several ways. How popular a given project
                                genre is from the entrepreneurs' perspective is one way to gauge popularity. This would indicate
                                a lot of interest from the creators to provide products and services in that category. Another
                                way to quantify project popularity is to see how the response from the crowd is. How well
                                is the buyer audience responding to certain project categories. This type of evaluation will
                                dictate what buyers are ultimately willing pay for an idea that has yet to come to fruition.
                                <p>
                                    There are more ways to measure these projects in a more business-savvy aspect as well. For instance which types of projects
                                    end up succeeding (reaching their requested goal in USD) vs. those that do not (which
                                    dont get anything). This can be a very valuable metric when deciding if this is the right
                                    platform or if your future business is in demand.
                                    <p>

                                        The following visualizations provide some insight on some of these metrics. Each visualization is rendered in its own scene.
                                        At the top of the scene layout will be a description and purpose of the visualization
                                        followed by some buttons to alter visualization parameters. After that the visualization
                                        will be rendered for the user to explore the presented data to gather some insight.
                                        Each scene layout also houses some navigation buttons as well as the kickstarter
                                        logo to keep the global context of all the scenes.

                                        This essay will continue on each scene to go into further detail of the visualizations via an interactive slideshow. Please
                                        continue by either scrolling down or clicking on the down arrow which is location

                        <strong>Quantifying Projects Treemap</strong> - This visualization is intended to help the user get an idea
                        of which project categories are more popular than others based off preset metrics, number of projects
                        and number of backers. Please explore the data via the treemap below, think about what kind of projects
                        are more popular than others.
                        <br/> The viewer can interact with the treemap with the following aspects:
                        <br/>
                        <b>Parameters</b>: The data can be targeted towards number of projects or number of backers by the buttons
                        above the visual.
                        <br/>
                        <b>Triggers</b>: Clicking on a common color (which indicates main category) will drill down into that
                        category to view the sub categories. The viewer can also hover over individual boxes to get a popup
                        with more detailed information. This is also useful for boxes where the name of the category cannot
                        fit, hovering will reveal the boxes information.
                        <br/>
                        <b>Annotations</b>: There exists a single box outlined in dark red. This annotation brings attention
                        towards the highest ratio of number of backers to number of projects (highest average backers per
                        project). This is to bring attention that even though other boxes may be more popular due to strict
                        metrics alone, we can still evaluate based on popularity ratios. This annotation will hide itself
                        when drilling down into other main categories.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Project State Stacked Bar Chart</strong> - This visualization is intended to help the user get an
                        idea of which project categories are more successful than others. The targeted intuition of this
                        chart is to notice that just because a project type is not the most popular, it can be more successful
                        which is a powerful insight.
                        <br/> The viewer can interact with the stacked bar chart with the following aspects:
                        <br/>
                        <b>Parameters</b>: The data can be targeted towards number of projects or precentage of success.
                        <br/>
                        <b>Triggers</b>: Clicking on a bar will drill down into the catories sub categories. Also hovering will
                        introduce a popup.
                        <br/>
                        <b>Annotations</b>: Right from the start of the visualization there are two annotations that leads the
                        viewer to notice that even though there are much more successful projects in other categories, there
                        does exist other categoires with higher rate of success. When switching parameters, another annotation
                        appears that informs the user that a category that aims to raise the highest goals in USD is the
                        least likely to succeed.

                    <h4>Closing</h4>

                    <p>Hopefully the visualizations gave some insight on how various kickstarter projects perform. A conclusion
                        can be made that even though Film, Design and Games are much more popular in terms of pure number
                        of projects, there seems to be more of a demand for theater and dance projects in regards to the
                        ration per number of projects started.</p>

                    <p>I am planning to start a kickstarter campaign myself and this insight has helped me gauge my changes
                        of success. I will continue to gether further insight on other factors as well such as how well a
                        project obtains its goal funds successfully vs how much the project goal is asking to raise. This
                        will also narrow down certain success factors for weighing starting a campaign.
